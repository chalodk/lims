# Logout Fix - Testing Guide

## Problem Fixed
- **Issue**: Logout button caused infinite loading without redirecting to login page
- **Root Cause**: The `signOut` function only called Supabase auth logout but didn't handle UI state or redirection

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced useAuth Hook (`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`)
- Added `useRouter` import for navigation
- Updated `signOut` function to:
  - Set loading state during logout process
  - Clear authentication state immediately
  - Redirect to `/login` page after successful logout
  - Handle errors gracefully

### 2. Improved DashboardLayout (`src/components/layout/DashboardLayout.tsx`)
- Added logout loading state (`isLoggingOut`)
- Created `handleSignOut` function with error handling
- Enhanced logout button with:
  - Loading spinner during logout
  - Disabled state during logout
  - Dynamic text ("Cerrando sesión..." / "Cerrar sesión")

### 3. Better State Management
- Added proper cleanup in auth state change handler
- Protected auth state updates with `mounted` flag to prevent race conditions
- Fixed dependency array in useEffect to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## Testing Steps

1. **Login to the application**
2. **Click "Cerrar sesión" button**
3. **Verify:**
   - Button shows spinner and "Cerrando sesión..." text
   - User is redirected to login page within 1-2 seconds
   - No infinite loading occurs
   - Login page is properly accessible after logout

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ Immediate visual feedback (loading spinner)
- ✅ Quick redirect to login page
- ✅ Complete session cleanup
- ✅ No loading issues or crashes
- ✅ Proper error handling if logout fails

## Fallback Protection
- Middleware automatically redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`
- Auth state changes are properly handled
- Component unmounting is protected against memory leaks
